## Sales and Discounts Analysis
This project uses data analysis techniques to understand how sales and discounts relate to each other. We look at trends in sales, check if discounts are helping, and find unusual data points that need more attention.

## What This Project Does
Analyzes sales and discount data to understand the relationship between them.
Uses graphs to visualize important trends.
Finds unusual data (outliers) and discusses their impact on the overall analysis.
Standardizes data so that numbers are easier to compare.
## Key Concepts
# 1. Data Preprocessing
Before we analyze the data, we need to "clean" it. This involves:

Standardizing: Making sure that big numbers (like total sales) don't affect smaller numbers too much. We use something called the "z-score" to do this.
One-hot Encoding: Converting categories (like product type or region) into numbers. Machine learning algorithms need numbers to work properly, so this step is important.
# 2. Analyzing Sales Data
We look at how much money the company makes from sales and how many discounts are given. We use graphs to show the following:

Sales Distribution: We create a histogram to show how many sales happen at different price points.
Discounts Effect: We check if offering discounts leads to higher sales.
Outliers: Some sales or discounts are much higher or lower than expected. These "outliers" could be mistakes or special cases.
# 3. Visualizing the Data
We create different types of graphs:

Boxplot: Shows the spread of sales and discounts, highlighting any unusual data points.
Bar Chart: Compares the performance of different product categories to see which ones are doing well and which need improvement.
# 4. Summary of Findings
Most of the company's sales come from a few high-value transactions.
Discounts do increase sales, but after a certain point, more discounts don't lead to much more sales.
There are some unusual sales and discount amounts that need to be checked further.
## How to Run the Code
Install Jupyter Notebook and the required Python libraries (like pandas and matplotlib).
Open the notebook in Jupyter and run the cells step by step to see the analysis.
Libraries Used
pandas: Helps manage and analyze data.
matplotlib: Creates graphs and charts to visualize data.
seaborn: Makes pretty graphs with less code.
numpy: Helps with math operations like standardizing data.
## Conclusion
This project helps a company understand how effective their discount strategies are and what areas need improvement. By focusing on high-value customers and adjusting their discount policies, the company can grow its revenue more efficiently.
